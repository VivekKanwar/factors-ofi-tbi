	abstract = {Background
Trauma is a leading cause of mortality and morbidity worldwide. Identifying Opportunities for Improvement (OFI) and corresponding corrective actions is a cornerstone in trauma quality improvement programs. Many patients with severe trauma are admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU), but little is known about OFI in this cohort. The aim of this study was to characterize OFI in adult trauma patients admitted to the ICU and assess how patient and process factors are associated with OFI in these patients.
Methods
A registry-based study of adult trauma patients admitted to the ICU between 2013 and 2023 at the Karolinska University Hospital in Solna, Sweden, who were reviewed regarding the presence of OFI. We used logistic regression to determine unadjusted and adjusted associations between patient and process factors and OFI.
Results
A total of 1449 patients were included, out of which OFI were identified in 143 (9.9 \%) patients. The Revised Trauma Score (OR 1.25; 95 \% CI 1.12, 1.40; p {\textless} 0.001) and survival 30 days after injury (OR 1.85; 95 \% CI 1.03, 3.51; p = 0.048) were significantly associated with OFI.
Conclusion
The care of patients who are physiologically more stable on admission to the ICU is more likely to be associated with OFI. This association is particularly pronounced in patients who ultimately die. These patients are a potential target group for a focused retrospective review process, aiming to identify interventions to improve the quality of their care.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To describe the current state of the art regarding management of the critically ill trauma patient with an emphasis on initial management in the ICU.
DATA SOURCES AND STUDY SELECTION: A PubMed literature review was performed for relevant articles in English related to the management of adult humans with severe trauma. Specific topics included airway management, hemorrhagic shock, resuscitation, and specific injuries to the chest, abdomen, brain, and spinal cord.
DATA EXTRACTION AND DATA SYNTHESIS: The basic principles of initial management of the critically ill trauma patients include rapid identification and management of life-threatening injuries with the goal of restoring tissue oxygenation and controlling hemorrhage as rapidly as possible. The initial assessment of the patient is often truncated for procedures to manage life-threatening injuries. Major, open surgical procedures have often been replaced by nonoperative or less-invasive approaches, even for critically ill patients. Consequently, much of the early management has been shifted to the ICU, where the goal is to continue resuscitation to restore homeostasis while completing the initial assessment of the patient and watching closely for failure of nonoperative management, complications of procedures, and missed injuries.
CONCLUSIONS: The initial management of critically ill trauma patients is complex. Multiple, sometimes competing, priorities need to be considered. Close collaboration between the intensivist and the surgical teams is critical for optimizing patient outcomes.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVES: To evaluate the most up-to-date burden of traumatic brain injury (TBI) and spinal cord injury (SCI) and analyse their leading causes in different countries/territories.
DESIGN: An analysis of Global Burden of Disease (GBD) data.
SETTING: The epidemiological data were gathered from GBD Results Tool (1 January, 1990─31 December 2019) covering 21 GBD regions and 204 countries/ territories.
PARTICIPANTS: Patients with TBI/SCI.
MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: Absolute numbers and age-standardised rates/estimates of incidence, prevalence and years lived with disability (YLDs) of TBI/SCI by location in 2019, with their percentage changes from 1990 to 2019. The leading causes (eg, falls) of TBI/SCI in 204 countries/territories.
RESULTS: Globally, in 2019, TBI had 27.16 million new cases, 48.99 million prevalent cases and 7.08 million YLDs. SCI had 0.91 million new cases, 20.64 million prevalent cases and 6.20 million YLDs. Global age-standardised incidence rates of TBI decreased significantly by -5.5\% (95\% uncertainty interval -8.9\% to -3.0\%) from 1990 to 2019, whereas SCI had no significant change (-6.1\% (-17.3\% to 1.5\%)). Regionally, in 2019, Eastern Europe and High-income North America had the highest burden of TBI and SCI, respectively. Nationally, in 2019, Slovenia and Afghanistan had the highest age-standardised incidence rates of TBI and SCI, respectively. For TBI, falls were the leading cause in 74\% (150/204) of countries/territories, followed by pedestrian road injuries (14\%, 29/204), motor vehicle road injuries (5\%, 11/204), and conflict and terrorism (2\%, 4/204). For SCI, falls were the leading cause in 97\% (198/204) of countries/territories, followed by conflict and terrorism (3\%, 6/204).
CONCLUSIONS: Global age-standardised incidence rates of TBI have decreased significantly since 1990, whereas SCI had no significant change. The leading causes of TBI/SCI globally were falls, but variations did exist between countries/territories. Policy-makers should continue to prioritise interventions to reduce falls, but priorities may vary between countries/territories.},

	abstract = {PURPOSE OF REVIEW: This review aims to summarize recent developments for the management of severe traumatic brain injury (TBI) in the ICU. Recent advancements in TBI ICU management emphasize a progression toward more multimodal approaches and mitigating secondary brain injury by increased focus on careful systemic management.
RECENT FINDINGS: Invasive monitoring techniques such as continuous intracranial pressure (ICP) and brain tissue oxygen pressure (PbtO 2 ) monitoring are considered standard of care or may become crucial, respectively, for managing severe TBI. Technological advances in noninvasive techniques (e.g. quantitative pupillometry) are likely to advance our diagnostic and prognostic ability. Blood biomarkers, including glial fibrillary acidic protein, neurofilament light chain, and ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1, provide minimally invasive ways to better assess injury severity and predict outcomes. These advancements support personalized care, which will likely influence clinical management strategies in the future.
SUMMARY: ICP monitoring remains a key component of severe TBI management in ICU. Emerging evidence is slowly changing and improving intensive care and patient outcomes and include both brain-targeted therapies and careful systemic intensive care management.},

Treatment aims to prevent additional brain damage and to optimise conditions for brain recovery. TBI is typically considered and treated as one pathological entity, although in fact it is a syndrome comprising a range of lesions that can require different therapies and physiological goals. Owing to advances in monitoring and imaging, there is now the potential to identify specific mechanisms of brain damage and to better target treatment to individuals or subsets of patients. Targeted treatment is especially relevant for elderly people-who now represent an increasing proportion of patients with TBI-as preinjury comorbidities and their therapies demand tailored management strategies.

The severity of traumatic brain injury can range from mild transient neurological dysfunction or impairment to severe profound disability that leaves patients completely non-functional. Indications for treatment differ based on the injury’s severity, but one of the goals of early treatment is to prevent secondary brain injury. Hemodynamic stability, monitoring and treatment of intracranial pressure, maintenance of cerebral perfusion pressure, support of adequate oxygenation and ventilation, administration of hyperosmolar agents and/or sedatives, nutritional support, and seizure prophylaxis are the mainstays of medical treatment for severe traumatic brain injury. Surgical management options include decompressive craniectomy or cerebrospinal fluid drainage via the insertion of an external ventricular drain.

The aim of this review is to provide clinicians with a summary of recent studies of direct relevance to the management of traumatic brain injury in order to promote best clinical practice. The use of tranexamic acid in the management of traumatic brain injury has been the focus of several studies, with one large randomised controlled trial suggesting a reduction in all-cause mortality within 24 h of injury. The use of therapeutic hypothermia does not improve neurological outcomes and maintenance of normothermia remains the optimal management strategy. For seizure management, levetiracetam appears to be as effective as phenytoin, but the optimal dose remains unclear. There has been a lack of clear outcome benefit for any individual osmotherapy agent, with no difference in mortality or neurological recovery. Early tracheostomy ({\textless} 7 days from injury) for patients with traumatic brain injury is associated with a reduction in the incidence of ventilator-associated pneumonia and duration of mechanical ventilation, critical care and hospital stay. Further research is needed in order to determine the optimal package of care and interventions.

This study aimed to analyze and compare the performance of the Level I Hamad Trauma Centre (HTC) with other TQIP participating centers by comparing TQIP aggregate database reports. The primary goal was to pinpoint the variations in adult trauma outcomes and quality measures, identify areas that need improvement, and leverage existing resources to facilitate quality improvement. Methods: A retrospective analysis was performed for the TQIP data from April 2019–March 2020 to April 2020–March 2021. We used the TQIP methodology, inclusion and exclusion criteria, and outcomes. Results: There were 915 patients from Fall 2020 and 884 patients from Fall 2021 that qualified for the TQIP database. The HTC patients’ demographics differed from the TQIP’s aggregate data; they were younger, more predominantly male, and had significantly different mechanisms of injury (MOI) with more traffic-related blunt trauma. Penetrating injuries were more severe in the other centers. During the TQIP Fall 2020 report, the HTC was a low outlier (good performer) in one cohort (all patients) and an average performer in the remaining cohorts. However, during Fall 2021, the HTC showed an improvement and was a low outlier in two cohorts (all patients and severe TBI patients). Overall, the HTC remained an average performer during the report cycles. Conclusions: There was an improvement over time in the risk-adjusted mortality, which reflects the continuous and demanding effort put together by the trauma team. The ACS-TQIP for the external benchmarking of quality improvement could be a contributor to better monitored patient care. Evaluating the TQIP data with emphases on appropriate methodologies, quality measurements, corrective measures, and accurate reporting is warranted.},

METHODS: A retrospective case review of deaths attributed to mechanical trauma throughout the state occurring between January 1, 2005, and December 31, 2005, was conducted. Cases were reviewed by a multidisciplinary panel of physicians and nonphysicians representing the prehospital and hospital phases of care. Deaths were judged frankly preventable, possibly preventable, or nonpreventable. The care rendered in both preventable and nonpreventable cases was evaluated for OFI according to nationally accepted guidelines.
RESULTS: The overall preventable death rate (frankly and possibly preventable) was 7\%. Among those patients surviving to be treated at a hospital, the preventable death rate was 11\%. OFIs in care were identified in 76\% of all cases; this cumulative proportion includes 51\% of prehospital contacts, 67\% of those treated in the emergency department (ED), and 40\% of those treated post-ED (operating room, intensive care unit, and floor). Issues with care were predominantly related to management of the airway, fluid resuscitation, and chest injury diagnosis and management.
CONCLUSIONS: The preventable death rate from trauma demonstrated in Utah is similar to that found in other settings where the trauma system is under development but has not reached full maturity. OFIs predominantly exist in the ED and relate to airway management, fluid resuscitation, and chest injury management. Resource organization and education of ED primary care providers in basic principles of stabilization and initial treatment may be the most cost-effective method of reducing preventable deaths in this mixed urban and rural setting. Similar opportunities exist in the prehospital and post-ED phases of care.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To identify patterns of errors contributing to inpatient trauma deaths.
METHODS: All inpatient trauma deaths at a high-volume level I trauma center from 1996 to 2004 inclusive were audited. Data were collected with daily trauma registry chart abstraction, weekly morbidity and mortality reports, hospital quality assurance reports, and annual trauma registry analyses of risk of death using TRISS and HARM methodology. Deaths that met criteria for low to medium probability of mortality or those with quality of care concerns were analyzed for errors and then subjected to 3-stage peer review at weekly departmental, monthly hospital, and annual regional forums. Patterns of errors were constructed from the compiled longitudinal data.
RESULTS: In 9 years, there were 44,401 trauma patient admissions and 2,594 deaths (5.8\%), of which 601 met low to medium mortality risks. Sixty-four patients (0.14\% admissions, 2.47\% deaths) had recognized errors in care that contributed to their death. Important error patterns included: failure to successfully intubate, secure or protect an airway (16\%), delayed operative or angiographic control of acute abdominal/pelvic hemorrhage (16\%), delayed intervention for ongoing intrathoracic hemorrhage (9\%), inadequate DVT or gastrointestinal prophylaxis (9\%), lengthy initial operative procedures rather than damage control surgery in unstable patients (8\%), over-resuscitation with fluids (5\%), and complications of feeding tubes (5\%). Resulting data-directed institutional and regional trauma system policy changes have demonstrably reduced the incidence of associated error-related deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: Preventable deaths will occur even in mature trauma systems. This review has identified error patterns that are likely common in all trauma systems, and for which policy interventions can be effectively targeted.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: The objective of this study was to analyze the preventable and potentially preventable deaths occurring at a mature Level I trauma center.
METHODS: All trauma patients that died during their initial hospital admission during an 8-year period (January, 1998 to December, 2005) were analyzed. The deaths were initially reviewed at a weekly Morbidity and Mortality (M\&M) conference followed by a multidisciplinary (Trauma Surgery, Critical Care, Emergency Medicine, Neurosurgery, Nursing, and Coroner) Combined Trauma Death Review Committee, and were classified into nonpreventable, potentially preventable, and preventable deaths. All preventable and potentially preventable deaths were identified for the purpose of the study. Quality improvement death forms included data on epidemiology, vital signs, injury severity, type of injury, probability of survival with Trauma and Injury Severity Score methodology, preventability (nonpreventable, potentially preventable, and preventable deaths), errors in the evaluation and management of the patient, and classification of errors (system, judgment, knowledge). Additional injury details, clinical course, circumstances leading to the death and autopsy findings were abstracted from the trauma registry and individual chart review.
RESULTS: During the study period, 35,311 patients meeting trauma registry criteria were admitted and a total of 2,081 (5.9\%) deaths occurred. Fifty-one deaths were classified as preventable or potentially preventable deaths (0.1\% of admissions, 2.5\% of deaths). Eleven of them (0.53\% of deaths) were classified as preventable and 40 (1.92\% of deaths) as potentially preventable deaths. Mean age was 40 years, 66.7\% were men, mean Injury Severity Score was 27, 74.5\% were blunt. The most common cause of death was bleeding (20, 39.2\%) followed by multiple organ dysfunction syndrome (14, 27.5\%) and cardiorespiratory arrest (8, 15.6\%). This was caused by a delay in treatment (27, 52.9\%), clinical judgment error (11, 21.6\%), missed diagnosis (6, 11.8\%), technical error (4, 7.8\%), and other (3, 5.9\%). The deaths peaked at two time periods: 26 (51.1\%) during the first 24 hours and 16 (31.4\%) after 7 days. Only one patient (2.0\%) died in the first hour. The most common location of death was the intensive care unit (28, 54.9\%), operating room (13, 25.5\%), and emergency room (5, 9.8\%).
CONCLUSION: Preventable or potentially preventable deaths are rare but do occur at an academic Level I trauma center. Delay in treatment and error in judgment are the leading causes of preventable and potentially preventable deaths.},

METHODS: We analyzed the Abu Dhabi Emirate Trauma Registry data of admitted patients who died in the emergency department or in hospital from 2014 to 2019. A panel of experts categorize the deaths into not preventable (NP), potentially preventable (PP), and definitely preventable (DP).
RESULTS: A total of 405 deaths were included, and 82.7\% were males. The majority (89.1\%) were NP, occurring mainly in the emergency department (40.4\%) and the intensive care unit (49.9\%). The combined potentially preventable and preventable death rate was 10.9\%. The median (Interquartile range) age of the DP was 57.5 (37-76) years, compared with 32 (24-42) and 34 (25-55) years for NP and PP, respectively (p = 0.008). Most of the PP deaths occurred in the intensive care unit (55.6\%), while the DP occurred mainly in the ward (50\%). Falls accounted for 25\% of PP and DP. Deficiencies in airway care, hemorrhage control, and fluid management were identified in 25\%, 43.2\% and 29.5\% of the DP/PP deaths, respectively. Seventy-two percent of the Airway deficiencies occurred in the prehospital, while 34.1\% of hemorrhage control deficiencies were in the emergency department. Fluid management deficiencies occurred in the emergency department and the operation theater.
CONCLUSIONS: DP and PP deaths comprised 10.9\% of the deaths. Most of the DP occurred in the emergency department and ward. Prehospital Airway and in-hospital hemorrhage and excessive fluid were the main areas for opportunities for improvement.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: The state legislature codified and funded the Arkansas Trauma System (ATS) in 2009. Quarterly preventable mortality reviews (PMRs) by the ATS began in 2015 and were used to guide state-wide targeted education to reduce preventable or potentially preventable (P/PP) deaths. We present the results of this PMR-education initiative from 2015 to 2022.
STUDY DESIGN: The ATS uses a statistical sampling model of the Arkansas Trauma Registry to select {\textasciitilde}40\% of the deaths for quarterly review, reflecting the overall the Arkansas Trauma Registry mortality population. A multispecialty PMR committee reviews the medical records from prehospital care to death, and hospital and regional advisory council reviews for each death. The PMR committee assigns opportunities for improvement (OFIs), cause(s) of death, and the likelihood of preventability for each case. Education to improve trauma care includes annual state-wide trauma meetings, novel classes targeted at level III/IV trauma center hospital providers, trauma evidence-based guidelines, and PMR "pearls."
RESULTS: We reviewed 1,979 deaths with 211 (10.6\%) deaths judged to be P/PP deaths. There was a progressive decrease in P/PP deaths and OFIs for P/PP deaths. Five OFI types targeted by education accounted for 72\% of the 24 possible OFI types in the P/PP cases, and 94\% of the "contributory OFIs." Reductions in "delay in treatment" resulted in the most rapid decrease in P/PP deaths.
CONCLUSIONS: Using ongoing PMR studies to target provider education led to a reduction in P/PP deaths and OFIs for P/PP deaths. Focusing on education designed to improve preventable mortality can result in a substantial decrease in P/PP deaths by 43\% (14\% to 8\%) for trauma systems.},

	abstract = {INTRODUCTION: Trauma is a leading cause of death in individuals aged 45 and younger, contributing significantly to the global disease burden. Local trauma quality improvement programs have been implemented to improve clinical practice and patient outcomes. Multidisciplinary peer reviews, included in quality improvement programs, aim to identify opportunities for improvement in trauma patient care and implement corrective measures. This study assesses the incidence and trends of these opportunities across clinically important trauma cohorts.
METHODS: We conducted a retrospective cohort study using data from the trauma registry at Karolinska University Hospital in Solna, Sweden, between 2017 and 2022. Patients screened for opportunities for improvement were categorized into common trauma cohorts. Logistic regression was used to analyze trends in the occurrence of opportunities for improvement over the years in each cohort. The relationship between opportunities for improvement and trauma cohorts was also assessed.
RESULTS: Out of 7192 patients included, 404 (6\%) had at least one opportunity for improvement. A statistically significant decrease in opportunities for improvement per year was observed overall (OR 0.90; 95\% CI 0.84 to 0.95). Significant decreases were identified in patients with blunt multisystem trauma without traumatic brain injury (TBI) (OR 0.82; 95\% CI 0.72 to 0.93), isolated severe TBI (OR 0.61; 95\% CI 0.41 to 0.91), and severe penetrating injuries (OR 0.68; 95\% CI 0.50 to 0.92). The blunt multisystem with TBI cohort showed a non-significant increase. After adjusting for Injury Severity Score, only the blunt multisystem without TBI cohort remained significantly associated with opportunities for improvement (OR 1.69; 95\% CI 1.24 to 2.31).
CONCLUSION: The incidence of opportunities for improvement in trauma care showed a significant decrease, indicating that the current trauma quality improvement program at Karolinska University Hospital may be effective in reducing opportunities for improvement. Patients with blunt multisystem trauma without TBI were at higher risk for opportunities for improvement compared with other trauma cohorts.

METHODS: We conducted a registry-based study using all patients between 2017 and 2021 from the Karolinska University Hospital who had been reviewed regarding the presence of OFI as defined by a morbidity and mortality conference. We used bi- and multivariable logistic regression to assess the associations between the following patient and process factors and OFI: age, sex, respiratory rate, systolic blood pressure, Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), Injury Severity Score (ISS), survival at 30 days, highest hospital care level, arrival on working hours, arrival on weekends, intubation status and time to first computed tomography (CT).
RESULTS: OFI was identified in 300 (5.8\%) out of 5182 patients. Age, missing Glasgow Coma Scale, time to first CT, highest hospital care level and ISS were statistically significantly associated with OFI.
CONCLUSION: Several patient and process factors were found to be associated with OFI, indicating that patients with moderate to severe trauma and those with delays to first CT are at the highest odds of OFI.},

Current prehospital traumatic brain injury guidelines utilize a systolic blood pressure threshold of {\textless}90mmHg for treating hypotension (age≥10) based on studies showing higher mortality when blood pressure drops below this level. However, the guidelines also acknowledge the weakness of the supporting evidence.

Objective
In a statewide, multisystem study of traumatic brain injury, to evaluate whether any statistically supportable systolic pressure-versus-mortality threshold emerges from the data, a priori, without assuming that a cut-point exists.

Design
Observational evaluation of a large prehospital database established as a part of the Excellence in Prehospital Injury Care (EPIC) Traumatic Brain Injury Study (NIH/NINDS-1R01NS071049). The generalized additive model and logistic regression were utilized to determine the relationship between systolic pressure and probability of death, adjusting for significant/important confounders.

Setting
The pre-implementation cohort (1/1/2007–3/31/2014) of the EPIC Study.

Participants
Patients (age≥10) with moderate/severe traumatic brain injury (Barell Matrix-Type 1 and/or International Classification of Disease-9 head region severity ≥3 and/or Abbreviated Injury Scale head-region severity ≥3) and lowest prehospital systolic pressure between 40 and 119mmHg were included.

Main Outcome Measure
The main outcome measure was in-hospital mortality.

Results
Among the 3,844 included cases, the model revealed a monotonically-decreasing relationship between systolic pressure and adjusted probability of death across the entire range (40–119mmHg). Each ten-point increase of systolic pressure was associated with a decrease in the adjusted odds of death of 18.8\% (aOR=0.812; 95\% confidence interval: 0.748–0.883). Thus, the adjusted odds of mortality increase as much for a drop from, say, 110 to 100mmHg as for 90 to 80mmHg, and so on, throughout the range.

Conclusions and Relevance
We found a linear relationship between lowest prehospital systolic blood pressure and severity-adjusted probability of mortality across an exceptionally wide range. There is no identifiable threshold or inflection point between 40 and 119mmHg. Thus, in traumatic brain injury, the concept that 90mmHg represents a unique or important physiological “cut-point” may be wrong. Furthermore, clinically-meaningful “hypotension” may not be as low as current guidelines suggest. Randomized trials evaluating treatment levels significantly above 90mmHg are needed.},

We prospectively studied the outcome from severe head injury (GCS score {\textless} or = 8) in 717 cases in the Traumatic Coma Data Bank. We investigated the impact on outcome of hypotension (SBP {\textless} 90 mm Hg) and hypoxia (Pao2 {\textless} or = 60 mm Hg or apnea or cyanosis in the field) as secondary brain insults, occurring from injury through resuscitation. Hypoxia and hypotension were independently associated with significant increases in morbidity and mortality from severe head injury. Hypotension was profoundly detrimental, occurring in 34.6\% of these patients and associated with a 150\% increase in mortality. The increased morbidity and mortality related to severe trauma to an extracranial organ system appeared primarily attributable to associated hypotension. Improvements in trauma care delivery over the past decade have not markedly altered the adverse influence of hypotension. Hypoxia and hypotension are common and detrimental secondary brain insults.

The aim of this study was to elucidate the benefits of immediate whole-body CT after hospital arrival in patients with severe trauma with the hypothesis that immediate CT within 10 min is associated with lower in-hospital mortality.
METHOD: This retrospective cohort study of patients with an injury severity score of more than 15 who underwent whole-body CT was conducted using the Japanese Trauma Databank (2019-2020). An immediate CT was conducted within 10 min after arrival. In-hospital mortality, frequency of subsequent surgery, and time to surgery were compared with immediate and non-immediate CT. Inverse probability weighting was conducted to adjust for patient backgrounds, including mechanism and severity of injury, prehospital treatment, vital signs, and institutional characteristics.
RESULTS: Among the 7832 patients included, 646 underwent immediate CT. Immediate CT was associated with lower in-hospital mortality (12.5 versus 15.7 per cent; adjusted OR 0.77 (95 per cent c.i. 0.69 to 0.84); P {\textless} 0.001) and fewer damage-control surgeries (OR 0.75 (95 per cent c.i. 0.65 to 0.87)). There was a 10 to 20 min difference in median time to craniotomy, laparotomy, and angiography. These benefits were observed regardless of haemodynamic instability on hospital arrival, while they were identified only in elderly patients with severe injury and altered consciousness.
CONCLUSION: Immediate CT within 10 min after arrival was associated with decreased in-hospital mortality in severely injured trauma patients.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Tranexamic acid reduces surgical bleeding and decreases mortality in patients with traumatic extracranial bleeding. Intracranial bleeding is common after traumatic brain injury (TBI) and can cause brain herniation and death. We aimed to assess the effects of tranexamic acid in patients with TBI.
METHODS: This randomised, placebo-controlled trial was done in 175 hospitals in 29 countries. Adults with TBI who were within 3 h of injury, had a Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) score of 12 or lower or any intracranial bleeding on CT scan, and no major extracranial bleeding were eligible. The time window for eligibility was originally 8 h but in 2016 the protocol was changed to limit recruitment to patients within 3 h of injury. This change was made blind to the trial data, in response to external evidence suggesting that delayed treatment is unlikely to be effective. We randomly assigned (1:1) patients to receive tranexamic acid (loading dose 1 g over 10 min then infusion of 1 g over 8 h) or matching placebo. Patients were assigned by selecting a numbered treatment pack from a box containing eight packs that were identical apart from the pack number. Patients, caregivers, and those assessing outcomes were masked to allocation. The primary outcome was head injury-related death in hospital within 28 days of injury in patients treated within 3 h of injury. We prespecified a sensitivity analysis that excluded patients with a GCS score of 3 and those with bilateral unreactive pupils at baseline. All analyses were done by intention to treat. This trial was registered with ISRCTN (ISRCTN15088122), ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT01402882), EudraCT (2011-003669-14), and the Pan African Clinical Trial Registry (PACTR20121000441277).
RESULTS: Between July 20, 2012, and Jan 31, 2019, we randomly allocated 12 737 patients with TBI to receive tranexamic acid (6406 [50·3\%] or placebo [6331 [49·7\%], of whom 9202 (72·2\%) patients were treated within 3 h of injury. Among patients treated within 3 h of injury, the risk of head injury-related death was 18·5\% in the tranexamic acid group versus 19·8\% in the placebo group (855 vs 892 events; risk ratio [RR] 0·94 [95\% CI 0·86-1·02]). In the prespecified sensitivity analysis that excluded patients with a GCS score of 3 or bilateral unreactive pupils at baseline, the risk of head injury-related death was 12·5\% in the tranexamic acid group versus 14·0\% in the placebo group (485 vs 525 events; RR 0·89 [95\% CI 0·80-1·00]). The risk of head injury-related death reduced with tranexamic acid in patients with mild-to-moderate head injury (RR 0·78 [95\% CI 0·64-0·95]) but not in patients with severe head injury (0·99 [95\% CI 0·91-1·07]; p value for heterogeneity 0·030). Early treatment was more effective than was later treatment in patients with mild and moderate head injury (p=0·005) but time to treatment had no obvious effect in patients with severe head injury (p=0·73). The risk of vascular occlusive events was similar in the tranexamic acid and placebo groups (RR 0·98 (0·74-1·28). The risk of seizures was also similar between groups (1·09 [95\% CI 0·90-1·33]).
INTERPRETATION: Our results show that tranexamic acid is safe in patients with TBI and that treatment within 3 h of injury reduces head injury-related death. Patients should be treated as soon as possible after injury.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Published work suggests a survival benefit for patients with trauma who undergo total-body CT scanning during the initial trauma assessment; however, level 1 evidence is absent. We aimed to assess the effect of total-body CT scanning compared with the standard work-up on in-hospital mortality in patients with trauma.
METHODS: We undertook an international, multicentre, randomised controlled trial at four hospitals in the Netherlands and one in Switzerland. Patients aged 18 years or older with trauma with compromised vital parameters, clinical suspicion of life-threatening injuries, or severe injury were randomly assigned (1:1) by ALEA randomisation to immediate total-body CT scanning or to a standard work-up with conventional imaging supplemented with selective CT scanning. Neither doctors nor patients were masked to treatment allocation. The primary endpoint was in-hospital mortality, analysed in the intention-to-treat population and in subgroups of patients with polytrauma and those with traumatic brain injury. The χ(2) test was used to assess differences in mortality. This trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, number NCT01523626.
FINDINGS: Between April 22, 2011, and Jan 1, 2014, 5475 patients were assessed for eligibility, 1403 of whom were randomly assigned: 702 to immediate total-body CT scanning and 701 to the standard work-up. 541 patients in the immediate total-body CT scanning group and 542 in the standard work-up group were included in the primary analysis. In-hospital mortality did not differ between groups (total-body CT 86 [16\%] of 541 vs standard work-up 85 [16\%] of 542; p=0.92). In-hospital mortality also did not differ between groups in subgroup analyses in patients with polytrauma (total-body CT 81 [22\%] of 362 vs standard work-up 82 [25\%] of 331; p=0.46) and traumatic brain injury (68 [38\%] of 178 vs 66 [44\%] of 151; p=0.31). Three serious adverse events were reported in patients in the total-body CT group (1\%), one in the standard work-up group ({\textless}1\%), and one in a patient who was excluded after random allocation. All five patients died.
INTERPRETATION: Diagnosing patients with an immediate total-body CT scan does not reduce in-hospital mortality compared with the standard radiological work-up. Because of the increased radiation dose, future research should focus on the selection of patients who will benefit from immediate total-body CT.

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: In 1999, an Utstein Template for Uniform Reporting of Data following Major Trauma was published. Few papers have since been published based on that template, reflecting a lack of international consensus on its feasibility and use. The aim of the present revision was to further develop the Utstein Template, particularly with a major reduction in the number of core data variables and the addition of more precise definitions of data variables. In addition, we wanted to define a set of inclusion and exclusion criteria that will facilitate uniform comparison of trauma cases.
METHODS: Over a ten-month period, selected experts from major European trauma registries and organisations carried out an Utstein consensus process based on a modified nominal group technique.
RESULTS: The expert panel concluded that a New Injury Severity Score {\textgreater} 15 should be used as a single inclusion criterion, and five exclusion criteria were also selected. Thirty-five precisely defined core data variables were agreed upon, with further division into core data for Predictive models, System Characteristic Descriptors and for Process Mapping.
CONCLUSION: Through a structured consensus process, the Utstein Template for Uniform Reporting of Data following Major Trauma has been revised. This revision will enhance national and international comparisons of trauma systems, and will form the basis for improved prediction models in trauma care.},

              Purpose
              Validation of registries is important to ensure accuracy of data and registry-based research. This is often done by comparisons of the original registry data with other sources, e.g. another registry or a re-registration of data. Founded in 2011, the Swedish Trauma Registry (SweTrau) consists of variables based on international consensus (the Utstein Template of Trauma). This project aimed to perform the first validation of SweTrau.
            
            
              Methods
              
                On-site re-registration was performed on randomly selected trauma patients and compared to the registration in SweTrau. Accuracy (exact agreement), correctness (exact agreement plus data within acceptable range), comparability (similarity with other registries), data completeness (1-missing data) and case completeness (1-missing cases) were deemed as either good (
                
                  
                    \$\${\textbackslash}ge\$\$

                85\%), adequate (70–84\%) or poor ({\textless} 70\%). Correlation was determined as either excellent (

                0.8), strong (0.6–0.79), moderate (0.4–0.59) or weak ({\textless} 0.4).
              
            
            
              Results
              The data in SweTrau had good accuracy (85.8\%), correctness (89.7\%) and data completeness (88.5\%), as well as strong or excellent correlation (87.5\%). Case completeness was 44.3\%, however, for NISS {\textgreater} 15 case completeness was 100\%. Median time to registration was 4.5 months, with 84.2\% registered one year after the trauma. The comparability showed an accordance with the Utstein Template of Trauma of almost 90\%.
            
            
              Conclusions
              The validity of SweTrau is good, with high accuracy, correctness, data completeness and correlation. The data are comparable to other trauma registries using the Utstein Template of Trauma; however, timeliness and case completeness are areas of improvement.},

	abstract = {The Trauma Score (TS) has been revised. The revision includes Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS), systolic blood pressure (SBP), and respiratory rate (RR) and excludes capillary refill and respiratory expansion, which were difficult to assess in the field. Two versions of the revised score have been developed, one for triage (T-RTS) and another for use in outcome evaluations and to control for injury severity (RTS). T-RTS, the sum of coded values of GCS, SBP, and RR, demonstrated increased sensitivity and some loss in specificity when compared with a triage criterion based on TS and GCS values. T-RTS correctly identified more than 97\% of nonsurvivors as requiring trauma center care. The T-RTS traige criterion does not require summing of the coded values and is more easily implemented that the TS criterion. RTS is a weighted sum of coded variable values. The RTS demonstrated substantially improved reliability in outcome predictions for compared to the TS. The RTS also yielded more accurate outcome predictions for patients with serious head injuries than the TS.},

	abstract = {OBJECTIVE: To better match hospital resources to patients' needs of trauma care, a protocol for facilitating in-hospital triage decisions was implemented at a Swedish level I trauma centre. In the protocol, physiological parameters, anatomical injuries and mechanism of injury were documented, and used to activate full or limited trauma team response. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the criteria-directed protocol to determine in-hospital trauma triage in an emergency department.
METHODS: Level of triage and triage rates were compared before and after implementation of the protocol. Overtriage and undertriage were assessed with injury severity score higher than 15 as the cutoff for defining major trauma. Medical records for undertriaged patients were retrospectively reviewed.
RESULTS: In 2011, 78\% of 1408 trauma team activations required full trauma response, with an overtriage rate of 74\% and an undertriage rate of 7\%. In 2013, after protocol implementation, 58\% of 1466 trauma team activations required full trauma response. Overtriage was reduced to 52\% and undertriage was increased to 10\%. However, there were no preventable deaths in the undertriaged patients.
CONCLUSION: A criteria-directed protocol for use in the emergency department was efficient in reducing overtriage rates without risking undertriaged patients' safety.},
